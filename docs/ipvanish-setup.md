# IPVanish VPN Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure WSJ Client with IPVanish VPN.

## Prerequisites

- Active IPVanish subscription
- IPVanish account credentials
- Note: IPVanish allows unlimited P2P/torrenting on all servers

## Getting Your Credentials

### Simple Setup

IPVanish uses your account credentials directly for VPN connections:

1. Your **email address** = OpenVPN username
2. Your **account password** = OpenVPN password

**That's it!** No need to generate separate VPN credentials.

### Alternative: SOCKS5 Proxy

IPVanish also offers SOCKS5 proxy (faster, but less secure):

- Not recommended for WSJ Client (use full VPN instead)

## Configuration

### OpenVPN Configuration (Standard)

Add to `.env`:

```bash
# VPN Configuration
VPN_SERVICE=ipvanish
OPENVPN_USER=your_email@example.com
OPENVPN_PASSWORD=your_account_password
```

Add these to `.env`:

```bash
VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=ipvanish
VPN_TYPE=openvpn
OPENVPN_USER=${OPENVPN_USER}
OPENVPN_PASSWORD=${OPENVPN_PASSWORD}
SERVER_COUNTRIES="United States"  # Optional
SERVER_CITIES="New York"          # Optional
FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=${PRIVATE_SUBNET}
TZ=${TIMEZONE}
```

### WireGuard Configuration

**Note:** IPVanish WireGuard support through Gluetun may be limited. OpenVPN is recommended.

If WireGuard is available:

```bash
# Add to .env
VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=ipvanish
VPN_TYPE=wireguard
WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=${WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY}
# ... additional WireGuard config
```

## Server Selection

IPVanish has 2000+ servers in 75+ locations worldwide. All servers support P2P.

### Popular Server Locations

**United States (Best Coverage):**

- Atlanta
- Boston
- Chicago
- Dallas
- Denver
- Las Vegas
- Los Angeles
- Miami
- New York
- Phoenix
- San Jose
- Seattle
- Washington DC

**Canada:**

- Frankfurt, Germany
- London, United Kingdom
- Paris, France
- Stockholm, Sweden
- Zurich, Switzerland

**Asia-Pacific:**

- Singapore
- Tokyo, Japan
- Sydney, Australia

### Specify Server Location

```bash
# By country
SERVER_COUNTRIES="United States"

# By city (more specific)
SERVER_CITIES="Chicago"

# By region/city
SERVER_REGIONS="Chicago"
```

## Port Forwarding

**IPVanish does NOT support port forwarding.**

This limitation affects torrenting:

- Cannot accept incoming peer connections
- Lower seeding ratios
- Reduced upload speeds

**Alternatives with port forwarding:**

- Private Internet Access (PIA)
- ProtonVPN
- AirVPN

## Verification

Test your IPVanish connection:

```bash
# Check VPN logs
docker logs vpn

# Verify IP (should show IPVanish server IP)
docker exec vpn wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io/ip

# Check connection details
docker exec vpn wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io/json

# Verify location
docker logs vpn 2>&1 | grep -i "connected"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

```bash
# Common issues:
# 1. Typo in email/password
# 2. Account suspended/expired

# Verify credentials:
# Email: your_email@example.com (must be exact)
# Password: your IPVanish account password

# Check account status at: https://www.ipvanish.com/account/
```

### Connection Timeout

```bash
# Try different server location
SERVER_CITIES="Los Angeles"

# Or different country
SERVER_COUNTRIES="Netherlands"

# Check IPVanish status: https://support.ipvanish.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001336313
```

### "Server not found" Error

```bash
# IPVanish server naming can be specific
# Try using country only first:
SERVER_COUNTRIES="United States"

# Then add city if needed:
SERVER_CITIES="New York"

# Check valid servers in Gluetun logs:
docker logs vpn 2>&1 | grep -i "available servers"
```

### Slow Speeds

```bash
# Choose geographically closer server
SERVER_CITIES="Seattle"  # Pick nearest city

# IPVanish OpenVPN may be slower than competitors
# This is inherent to IPVanish's network

# Try enabling fast connect (if supported)
# Or choose less congested servers
```

### Frequent Disconnections

```bash
# Enable persistent connection settings
# Add to .env if supported:

OPENVPN_PROTOCOL=udp  # UDP may be more stable
# or try TCP:
OPENVPN_PROTOCOL=tcp
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Optimized Settings for Torrenting

```bash
# Add to .env
VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=ipvanish
VPN_TYPE=openvpn
OPENVPN_USER=${OPENVPN_USER}
OPENVPN_PASSWORD=${OPENVPN_PASSWORD}
SERVER_COUNTRIES="Netherlands"  # Good for P2P
FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=${PRIVATE_SUBNET}
FIREWALL_VPN_INPUT_PORTS=6881   # Allow torrent port
TZ=${TIMEZONE}
```

### DNS Configuration

```bash
# Use IPVanish DNS (default)
# Automatically configured

# Or use custom DNS
DNS_ADDRESS="1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"  # Cloudflare
```

### Kill Switch

Built-in with Gluetun:

```bash
FIREWALL=on  # Default, blocks non-VPN traffic
```

### Protocol Selection

```bash
# Try UDP for better performance
OPENVPN_PROTOCOL=udp

# Or TCP for more reliability
OPENVPN_PROTOCOL=tcp
```
