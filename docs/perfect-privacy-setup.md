## Recommendation

**Good for WSJ Client if you value privacy AND torrenting:**

**Choose Perfect Privacy if:**
Port forwarding needed
Privacy is top priority
Budget is not a concern (~$13/month)
You want unlimited connections
Swiss jurisdiction important

**Choose alternatives if:**
Budget-conscious → PIA ($3/month with port forwarding)
Value-focused → ProtonVPN or Mullvad
More servers needed → PIA, NordVPN

Perfect Privacy is **excellent but expensive**. For most users, PIA or ProtonVPN offer better value with similar features.
